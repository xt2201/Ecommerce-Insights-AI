## ⚠️ Things to Watch Out For

Several products show suspicious patterns including perfect 5-star ratings with limited reviews and unusually low prices for advanced features. Exercise caution with products priced under $25 claiming premium ANC capabilities.

- Avoid products with perfect 5-star ratings and very few reviews (e.g., B0FZ3KZNKP)
- Be cautious of ultra-low priced ANC headphones under $25 (e.g., B0CDC4X65Q) as they may have fake ANC
- Some products with 70+ hour battery claims at very low prices may be exaggerating specifications
- Always verify recent review patterns before purchasing from lesser-known brands
