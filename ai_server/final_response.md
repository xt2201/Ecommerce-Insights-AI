## 🔍 How We Analyzed

**Data:** Analyzed 22 noise-cancelling headphones under $300, filtering by price, rating (≥4.0), and key features (ANC, Bluetooth, comfort).

**Method:** Assigned a value score using: (Rating × 2) + (Battery Hours ÷ 10) + Comfort Score (2 for over-ear) – (Price ÷ 50). Top products were evaluated for pros, cons, brand reputation, and real-world performance cues. Red flags (e.g., suspicious battery claims, low review volume) were assessed.

**Confidence:** HIGH - Confidence is high (0.92) due to consistent data across multiple sources and clear value differentiation. However, some lesser-known brands (e.g., TAGRY) have limited long-term reviews, introducing minor uncertainty about durability.

## ⚠️ Things to Watch Out For

One high-severity red flag was detected: the TAGRY Hybrid ANC (B0FRM53NB8) claims 120-hour battery life at $69.99 with a perfect 5-star rating, which is unusually high and may indicate over-stated specs or review padding. Other concerns include low review counts for some top-rated items and potential connectivity issues with lower-rated models.

- TAGRY 120h battery life likely drops to 30-40 hours with ANC on—verify real-world usage.
- B0FGG71BRD bundle has only 7 reviews—limited long-term reliability data.
- Echo Buds (B085WTY1HQ) have a 3.6★ rating with reported ANC and connectivity issues.
- Bowers & Wilkins Pi7 S2 has a low 3.7★ rating for a premium brand—potential quality issues.

## 💡 What's Next?

- Would you prefer a specific brand like Sony, Bose, or JBL, even if it means paying more?
- Do you need features like voice assistant support, app customization, or USB-C charging?
- Are you open to earbuds instead of over-ear headphones for a more compact design?
- Would you like a headphone with a detachable microphone for better call quality?
- Is maximum noise cancellation more important than battery life or comfort?

**Recommended:** If long workdays are common, prioritize battery life—consider the TAGRY 120h or JBL 770NC.
