  "market_segment": "Budget",
  "price_insight": "The sweet spot is between $30-$80, with most top products clustering below $100. The average price is $73.93, indicating a budget-friendly market with some mid-range options.",
  "brand_insight": "Anker (via Soundcore) dominates with two top products, followed by TOZO and Sony. Amazon's bundled offering also shows strong presence, but Anker/Sony are the primary brand leaders.",
  "gap_analysis": "High-end features like premium build quality or advanced microphone systems are underrepresented. Best value lies in hybrid ANC, long battery life (40-90h), and app customization at sub-$50 prices.",
  "recommendation_strategy": "Prioritize models with hybrid ANC, 40+ hour battery life, and app customization under $50 (e.g., Soundcore Q20i at $37.99). For brand trust, consider Sony WH-CH720N ($88) as a mid-range premium option within the $300 budget."
