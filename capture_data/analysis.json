Premium models ($150\u2011$200) like Beats Studio Pro and Bose QuietComfort deliver superior ANC, premium materials, and longer battery life, but they consume a larger portion of the $300 budget, limiting the number of units a user could buy.\n\nOverall, the budget\u2011vs\u2011quality trade\u2011off favors mid\u2011range headphones for this use\u2011case because they meet the core requirements (ANC, comfort, >30h battery) while leaving budget for potential accessories or multiple devices.",
